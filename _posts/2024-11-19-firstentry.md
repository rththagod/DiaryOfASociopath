It is common knowledge that people create blogs to talk about any stuff they like. Cooking, book reviews and so on. And there is nothing wrong with that. 
Many people however use these personal blogs as internet diaries where they can use their anonimity to vent their frustrations, anger with the world (society or something like that idk) and insults torwards so called horrible people.
These usually end up in schizo rants about nobody loving them and then end up with either a suicide note or a frustrated coming out in some of the cases.

However in this first entry you will not find any of these.

Instead here is a pseudo motivational message written by someone who never gave good advice (and probably suck at writing stuff).
Sometimes it feels you are losing everything in life. That society is unfair. It's not. You're simply falling into the trap of depression. I've been there. And I got out. 
Sure, it may feel like life is going nowhere but trust me. If the path of life was always shining rainbows it would be pretty dogshit IMHO. 
I know this may sound incredibly stupid. But even more stupid is the fact that while you suffer, your enemies are laughing at your suffering. Do not give them the joy. 
Fight back. Give them hell. And make them look stupid.

Like a famous pole said "Never lose hope, be persistent and stubborn and never give up. There are many instances in history where apparent losers suddenly turn out to be winners unexpectedly, so you should never conclude all hope is lost." Just never open his mail.
